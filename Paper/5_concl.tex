\section*{Conclusion}

In this paper, we develop a theory of how constraints faced by the US have realigned cooperation networks in the international system. Specifically, during times of US distraction, we find that the level of cooperation between China and non-democratic countries has notably increased. To arrive at this finding we not only developed a factor based measures of US distraction, but also a network based approach to understanding how cooperation with China is changing in the diplomatic and economic realms. Our distraction measure show notable variation over time and we provide face validity evidence for our estimated measures of cooperation. The implications from our findings highlight what simply examining conflict data cannot. China's role in the international	system is changing in measurable ways and its ability to potentially exert influence has become more notable in periods of US distraction.
