- dyadICEWSData_v2.csv
  - dyadic level file including measures of "preference" relations between 194 countries
  - timeframe: 1980-2019 (ICEWS variables only available from 1995-2019)
  - id variables:
    - cname1/2: country long
    - ccode1/2: country numeric identifier (see panel.rda for identification scheme and how it relates to cow)
    - dyad: concatenation of ccodes
    - year
    - id: concatenation of dyad and year
  - preference measures
    - idPt1/2: ideal point positions of countries on unidimensional UN voting space pulled directly from bailey et al
    - econNetProx (1980-2019):
      - a measure of state preference that is derived via tensor model that takes as inputs states relations on imf trade flows and economic agreements. higher values on this score indicate that states have higher levels of trade and economic agreements between them and more third order connections on those dimensions as well.
    - diplomacyNetProx (1980-2019):
      - a similarly derived measure that uses alliances and un votings as inputs instead.
    - icewsQuadNetProx (1995-2019):
      - a similarly derived measure that uses the icews quad variables as inputs instead (conflictual measures are rescaled so this can still be interpreted as a cooperation index).
    - super1NetProx (1995-2019):
      - same as above but here we use all the measures underlying the icews, diplomacy and econ indices.
    - super2NetProx (1980-2019):
      - here we use each of the diplomacy and econ indices.
    - MConf (1995-2019):
      - Raw count of material conflict events between the dyad-year
    - MCoop (1995-2019):
      - Raw count of material coop events between the dyad-year
    - VConf (1995-2019):
      - Raw count of verbal conflict events between the dyad-year
    - VCoop (1995-2019):
      - Raw count of verbal coop events between the dyad-year
- main1_final_w_dyad.csv
  - all of scott's variables
  - merged with country level versions of all the variables discussed in the dyadic file above, for example
    - econNetProx_france: is the averaged proximity of france to all other countries by year on the econNetProx index
- corrMatrix_v2.csv
  - this file summarizes the result of a basic correlation analysis between the PCA US distraction variables and the preference measures from the dyadic data
